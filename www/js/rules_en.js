'title': 'Rule 3 : Verification of credentials',
'text': "1.   Following general elections to the European Parliament, the President shall invite the competent authorities of the Member States to notify Parliament without delay of the names of the elected Members so that all Members may take their seats in Parliament with effect from the opening of the first sitting following the elections.\n\r\
\n\r\
At the same time, the President shall draw the attention of those authorities to the relevant provisions of the Act of 20 September 1976 and invite them to take the necessary measures to avoid any incompatibility with the office of Member of the European Parliament.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   Members whose election has been notified to Parliament shall declare in writing, before taking their seat in Parliament, that they do not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament within the meaning of Article 7(1) or (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976. Following general elections, the declaration shall be made, where possible, no later than six days prior to Parliament's first sitting following the elections. Until such time as Members' credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, and provided that they have previously signed the above-mentioned written declaration, they shall take their seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto.\n\r\
\n\r\
Where it is established from facts verifiable from sources available to the public that a Member holds an office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament, within the meaning of Article 7(1) or (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976, Parliament, on the basis of the information provided by its President, shall establish that there is a vacancy.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   On the basis of a report by the committee responsible, Parliament shall verify credentials without delay and rule on the validity of the mandate of each of its newly elected Members and also on any disputes referred to it pursuant to the provisions of the Act of 20 September 1976, other than those which, under that Act, fall exclusively under the national provisions to which that Act refers.\n\r\
\n\r\
The committee's report shall be based on the official notification by each Member State of the full results of the election, specifying the names of the candidates elected and those of any substitutes, together with their ranking in accordance with the results of the vote.\n\r\
\n\r\
The validity of the mandate of a Member may not be confirmed unless the written declarations required under this Rule and Annex I to these Rules of Procedure have been made.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   On the basis of a proposal by the committee responsible, Parliament shall, without delay, verify the credentials of individual Members who are replacing outgoing Members and may at any time rule on any dispute as to the validity of the mandate of any of its Members.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   Where the appointment of a Member is due to the withdrawal of candidates from the same list, the committee responsible shall ensure that the withdrawal in question has taken place in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Act of 20 September 1976 and Rule 4(2).\n\r\
\n\r\
6.   The committee responsible shall ensure that any information which may affect the eligibility of the Member or the eligibility or the ranking of the substitutes is forwarded to Parliament without delay by the authorities of the Member States or of the Union, with, in the case of an appointment, an indication of the date on which it will take effect.\n\r\
\n\r\
Should the competent authorities of the Member States initiate a procedure which might lead to the disqualification of a Member from holding office, the President shall ask them to keep him or her regularly informed of the stage reached in the procedure and shall refer the matter to the committee responsible. On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter."

\n\r\
2.   Members who resign shall notify the President of their resignation and of the date on which that resignation is to take effect, which may not be more than three months after notification. This notification shall take the form of an official record drawn up in the presence of the Secretary-General or his or her representative, signed by the latter and by the Member concerned and immediately submitted to the committee responsible, which shall enter it on the agenda of its first meeting following receipt of the document.\n\r\
\n\r\
If the committee responsible considers that the resignation is in compliance with the Act of 20 September 1976, a vacancy shall be declared with effect from the date indicated by the resigning Member in the official record, and the President shall inform Parliament thereof.\n\r\
\n\r\
If the committee responsible considers that the resignation is not in compliance with the Act of 20 September 1976, it shall propose to Parliament that it not declare a vacancy.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   Where no meeting of the committee responsible is scheduled before the next part-session, the rapporteur of the committee responsible shall immediately examine any resignation that has been duly notified. Where delay in considering the notification would be prejudicial, the rapporteur shall refer the matter to the committee Chair, requesting, pursuant to paragraph 2, that:\n\r\
\n\r\
-   the President be informed on behalf of the committee that a vacancy may be declared; or\n\r\
\n\r\
-   an extraordinary meeting of the committee be convened to examine specific difficulties noted by the rapporteur.\n\r\

4.   Where either the competent authorities of the Member States or of the Union or the Member concerned notifies the President of an appointment or election to an office that is incompatible with the office of Member of the European Parliament within the meaning of Article 7(1) or (2) of the Act of 20 September 1976, the President shall inform Parliament thereof, and Parliament shall declare that a vacancy exists from the date of the incompatibility.\n\r\
\n\r\
Where the competent authorities of the Member States notify the President of the end of the term of office of a Member of the European Parliament as a result either of an additional incompatibility established by the law of that Member State in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Act of 20 September 1976 or of the withdrawal of the Member’s mandate pursuant to Article 13(3) of that Act, the President shall inform Parliament that the term of office of that Member ended on the date communicated by competent authorities of the Member State. Where no such date is communicated, the date of the end of the term of office shall be the date of the notification by that Member State.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   Where the authorities of the Member States or of the Union inform the President of an assignment they intend to entrust to a Member, the President shall refer to the committee responsible the question of the compatibility of the proposed assignment with the Act of 20 September 1976 and shall inform Parliament, the Member and the authorities concerned of the conclusions reached by that committee.\n\r\
\n\r\
6.   When Parliament has established a vacancy, the President shall inform the Member State concerned thereof, and invite it to fill the seat without delay.\n\r\
\n\r\
7.   Where acceptance or termination of office appears to be based on material inaccuracy or vitiated consent, Parliament may declare the appointment under consideration to be invalid or may refuse to establish the vacancy."

\n\r\
2.   In exercising its powers on privileges and immunities, Parliament shall act to uphold its integrity as a democratic legislative assembly and to ensure the independence of its Members in the performance of their duties. Parliamentary immunity is not a Member's personal privilege but a guarantee of the independence of Parliament as a whole, and of its Members.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   A laissez-passer of the European Union allowing a Member to circulate freely in the Member States and in other countries which recognise it as a valid travel document shall be issued by the European Union to a Member at his or her request, on condition that the President of the Parliament gives his or her authorisation.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   For the purpose of performing their parliamentary duties, all Members shall have the right to participate actively in the work of Parliament’s committees and delegations in accordance with the provisions of these Rules of Procedure.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   Members shall be entitled to inspect any files held by Parliament or a committee, other than personal files and accounts, which only the Members concerned shall be allowed to inspect. Exceptions to this rule, concerning the handling of documents to which public access may be denied, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council(1), are laid down in Rule 210a.\n\r\
\n\r\
With the approval of the Bureau, a Member may, on the basis of a reasoned decision, be denied the right to inspect a Parliament document if, after hearing the Member concerned, the Bureau comes to the conclusion that such an inspection would cause unacceptable damage to Parliament’s institutional interests or to the public interest, and that the Member concerned is seeking to inspect the document for private and personal reasons. The Member may lodge a written appeal against such a decision within one month of the notification thereof. In order to be admissible, written appeals must include reasons. Parliament shall reach a decision on the appeal without debate during the part-session that follows its lodging.\n\r\

\n\r\
2.   Where Members are required to appear as witnesses or expert witnesses, there is no need to request a waiver of immunity, provided:\n\r\
\n\r\
-   that they will not be obliged to appear on a date or at a time which prevents them from performing their parliamentary duties, or makes it difficult for them to perform those duties, or that they will be able to provide a statement in writing or in any other form which does not make it difficult for them to perform their parliamentary duties; and\n\r\

'title': 'Rule 7 : Defence of privileges and immunity',
'text': "1.   In cases where it is alleged that an infringement of the privileges and immunities of a Member or former Member by the authorities of a Member State has occurred or is about to occur, a request for a Parliament decision as to whether those privileges and immunities have been or are likely to be breached may be made in accordance with Rule 9(1).\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   In particular, such a request for the defence of privileges and immunities may be made if it is considered that the circumstances would constitute an administrative or other restriction on the free movement of Members travelling to or from the place of meeting of Parliament or an administrative or other restriction on an opinion expressed or a vote cast in the performance of their duties, or that the circumstances would fall within the scope of Article 9 of the Protocol No 7 on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   A request for the defence of the privileges and immunities of a Member shall not be admissible if a request for the waiver or defence of that Member's immunity has already been received in respect of the same facts, whether or not that earlier request led to a decision.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   No further consideration shall be given to a request for the defence of the privileges and immunities of a Member if a request for the waiver of that Member's immunity is received in respect of the same facts.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   In cases where a decision has been taken not to defend the privileges and immunities of a Member, the Member may exceptionally make a request for reconsideration of the decision, by submitting new evidence in accordance with Rule 9(1). The request for reconsideration shall be inadmissible if proceedings have been instituted against the decision under Article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or if the President considers that the new evidence submitted is insufficiently substantiated to warrant reconsideration."

As a matter of urgency, in circumstances where a Member is arrested or has his or her freedom of movement curtailed in apparent breach of his or her privileges and immunities, the President may, after consulting the Chair and rapporteur of the committee responsible, take an initiative to assert the privileges and immunities of the Member concerned. The President shall notify the committee of that initiative and inform Parliament.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   When the President makes use of the powers conferred on him or her by paragraph 1, the committee shall take cognisance of the President's initiative at its next meeting. Where the committee deems it necessary, it may prepare a report for submission to Parliament."

'title': 'Rule 9 : Procedures on immunity',
'text': "1.   Any request addressed to the President by a competent authority of a Member State for the immunity of a Member to be waived, or by a Member or a former Member for privileges and immunities to be defended, shall be announced in Parliament and referred to the committee responsible.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   With the agreement of the Member or the former Member concerned, the request may be made by another Member, who shall be permitted to represent the Member or former Member concerned at all stages of the procedure.\n\r\
\n\r\
The Member representing the Member or the former Member concerned shall not be involved in the decisions taken by the committee.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   The committee shall consider, without delay but having regard to their relative complexity, requests for the waiver of immunity or requests for the defence of privileges and immunities.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   The committee shall make a proposal for a reasoned decision which recommends the adoption or rejection of the request for the waiver of immunity or for the defence of privileges and immunities. Amendments shall not be admissible. If a proposal is rejected, the contrary decision shall be deemed to have been adopted.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   The committee may ask the authority concerned to provide any information or explanation which the committee deems necessary in order for it to form an opinion on whether immunity should be waived or defended.\n\r\
\n\r\
6.   The Member concerned shall be given an opportunity to be heard and may present any documents or other written evidence deemed by that Member to be relevant.\n\r\
\n\r\
The Member concerned shall not be present during debates on the request for waiver or defence of his or her immunity, except for the hearing itself.\n\r\
\n\r\
The Chair of the committee shall invite the Member to be heard, indicating a date and time. The Member concerned may renounce the right to be heard.\n\r\
\n\r\
If the Member concerned fails to attend the hearing pursuant to that invitation, he or she shall be deemed to have renounced the right to be heard, unless he or she has asked to be excused from being heard on the date and at the time proposed, and has given his or her reasons. The Chair of the committee shall rule on whether such a request to be excused is to be accepted in view of the reasons given. The Member concerned shall not be permitted to appeal that ruling.\n\r\
\n\r\
If the Chair of the committee grants the request to be excused, he or she shall invite the Member concerned to be heard at a new date and time. If the Member concerned fails to comply with the second invitation to be heard, the procedure shall continue without the Member being heard. No further requests to be excused, or to be heard, may then be accepted.\n\r\
\n\r\
7.   Where the request seeks the waiver or the defence of immunity on several counts, each of these may be the subject of a separate decision. The committee's report may, exceptionally, propose that the waiver or the defence of immunity should apply solely to prosecution proceedings and that, until a final sentence is passed, the Member should be immune from any form of detention or remand or any other measure which prevents that Member from performing the duties proper to the mandate.\n\r\
\n\r\
8.   The committee may offer a reasoned opinion as to the competence of the authority in question and the admissibility of the request, but shall not, under any circumstances, pronounce on the guilt, or otherwise, of the Member, nor shall it pronounce on whether or not the opinions or acts attributed to the Member justify prosecution, even if the committee, in considering the request, acquires detailed knowledge of the facts of the case.\n\r\
\n\r\
9.   The committee's proposal for a decision shall be placed on the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled. No amendments may be tabled to such a proposal.\n\r\
\n\r\
Discussion shall be confined to the reasons for and against each proposal to waive or uphold immunity, or to defend a privilege or immunity.\n\r\
\n\r\
Without prejudice to Rule 164, the Member whose privileges or immunities are under consideration shall not speak in the debate.\n\r\
\n\r\
The proposal or proposals for a decision contained in the report shall be put to the vote at the first voting time following the debate.\n\r\
\n\r\
After Parliament has considered the matter, a separate vote shall be taken on each of the proposals contained in the report. If a proposal is rejected, the contrary decision shall be deemed to have been adopted.\n\r\
\n\r\
10.   The President shall immediately communicate Parliament's decision to the Member concerned and to the competent authority of the Member State concerned, with a request that the President be informed of any developments and judicial rulings in the relevant proceedings. When the President receives this information, he or she shall transmit it to Parliament in the way he or she considers most appropriate, if necessary after consulting the committee responsible.\n\r\
\n\r\
11.   The committee shall treat these matters, and handle any documents received with the utmost confidentiality. The committee shall always consider requests relating to procedures on immunity in camera.\n\r\
\n\r\
12.   Parliament shall only examine requests for the waiver of a Member's immunity that have been transmitted to it by the judicial authorities or by the Permanent Representations of the Member States.\n\r\
\n\r\
13.   The committee shall lay down principles for the application of this Rule.\n\r\
\n\r\
14.   Any inquiry as to the scope of Members' privileges or immunities made by a competent authority shall be dealt with in accordance with the above rules."

Parliament shall first vote on any proposal for the immediate rejection of Council's position that has been tabled in writing by the committee responsible, a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold. For it to be adopted, such a proposal for rejection shall require the votes of a majority of the component Members of Parliament.\n\r\
\n\r\
If that proposal for rejection is adopted, the Council's position is rejected and the President shall announce in Parliament that the legislative procedure is closed.\n\r\
\n\r\
If that proposal for rejection is not adopted, Parliament shall then proceed in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   Any provisional agreement tabled under Rule 69f(4) by the committee responsible  shall be given priority in voting and put to a single vote, unless, at the request of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, Parliament decides to proceed immediately with the vote on amendments in accordance with paragraph 3.\n\r\
\n\r\
If, in a single vote, the provisional agreement secures the votes of a majority of the component Members of Parliament, the President shall announce in Parliament that the second reading of Parliament has been concluded.\n\r\
\n\r\
If, in a single vote, the provisional agreement fails to secure the majority of the component Members of Parliament, Parliament shall then proceed in accordance with paragraphs 3, 4 and 5.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   Except where a proposal for rejection has been adopted in accordance with paragraph 1 or a provisional agreement has been adopted in accordance with paragraph 2, any amendments to the Council's position, including those contained in the provisional agreement tabled in accordance with Rule 69f(4) by the committee responsible, shall then be put to the vote. Any amendment to the Council's position shall be adopted only if it secures the votes of a majority of the component Members of Parliament.\n\r\
\n\r\
Before voting on the amendments, the President may ask the Commission to state its position and the Council to comment.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   Notwithstanding a vote by Parliament against the initial proposal to reject the Council's position under paragraph 1, Parliament may, on the proposal of the Chair or the rapporteur of the committee responsible or of a political group or Members reaching at least the low threshold, consider a further proposal for rejection after voting on the amendments under paragraphs 2 or 3. For it to be adopted, such a proposal shall require the votes of a majority of the component Members of Parliament.\n\r\
\n\r\
If the Council's position is rejected, the President shall announce in Parliament that the legislative procedure is closed.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   After the votes taken under paragraphs 1 to 4 and the votes subsequently taken on amendments to the draft legislative resolution relating to procedural requests, the President shall announce that the second reading of Parliament has been concluded and the legislative resolution shall be deemed to have been adopted. If necessary, the legislative resolution shall be modified, pursuant to Rule 193(2), in order to reflect the outcome of the votes taken under paragraphs 1 to 4 or the application of Rule 69a.\n\r\
\n\r\
The text of the legislative resolution and of Parliament's position, if any, shall be forwarded by the President to the Council and to the Commission.\n\r\
\n\r\
Where no proposal to reject or amend the Council's position has been tabled, it shall be deemed to have been approved."

\n\r\
2.   Decisions to enter into negotiations shall be announced at the beginning of the part-session following their adoption in committee. By the end of the day following the announcement in Parliament, Members or a political group or groups reaching at least the medium threshold may request in writing that a committee decision to enter into negotiations be put to the vote. Parliament shall then proceed to that vote during the same part-session.\n\r\
\n\r\
If no such request is received by the expiry of the deadline laid down in the first subparagraph, the President shall inform Parliament that this is the case. If a request is made, the President may, immediately prior to the vote, give the floor to one speaker in favour of the committee’s decision to enter into negotiations and to one speaker against that decision. Each speaker may make a statement lasting no more than two minutes.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   If Parliament rejects the committee’s decision to enter into negotiations, the draft legislative act and the report of the committee responsible shall be placed on the agenda of the following part-session, and the President shall set a deadline for amendments. Rule 59(4) shall apply.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   Negotiations may start at any time after the deadline laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 has expired without a request for a vote in Parliament on the decision to enter into negotiations having been made. If such a request has been made, negotiations may start at any time after the committee decision to enter into negotiations has been approved in Parliament.\n\r\
\n\r\
\n\r\
Rule 69d : Negotiations ahead of Council's first reading\n\r\
\n\r\
Where Parliament has adopted its position at first reading, that position shall constitute the mandate for any negotiations with other institutions.

The committee responsible may decide to enter into negotiations at any time thereafter.\n\r\
\n\r\
Where the Council position at first reading contains elements not covered by the draft legislative act or by Parliament's position at first reading, the committee may adopt guidelines, including in the form of amendments to the Council position, for the negotiating team.\n\r\
\n\r\
\n\r\
Rule 69f : Conduct of negotiations\n\r\
\n\r\
1.   Parliament's negotiating team shall be led by the rapporteur and shall be presided over by the Chair of the committee responsible or by a Vice-Chair designated by the Chair. It shall at least consist of the shadow rapporteurs from each political group that wishes to participate.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   Any document intended to be discussed at a meeting with the Council and the Commission ('trilogue') shall be circulated to the negotiating team at least 48 hours or, in cases of urgency, at least 24 hours in advance of that trilogue.\n\r\
\n\r\
3.   After each trilogue, the Chair of the negotiating team and the rapporteur shall, on behalf of the negotiating team, report back to the next meeting of the committee responsible.\n\r\
\n\r\
Where it is not feasible to convene a meeting of the committee in a timely manner, the Chair of the negotiating team and the rapporteur shall, on behalf of the negotiating team, report back to a meeting of the committee coordinators.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   If negotiations lead to a provisional agreement, the committee responsible shall be informed without delay. Documents reflecting the outcome of the concluding trilogue shall be made available to the committee responsible and shall be published. The provisional agreement shall be submitted to the committee responsible, which shall decide, by way of a single vote by a majority of the votes cast, whether to approve it. If approved, it shall be tabled for consideration by Parliament, in a presentation which clearly indicates the modifications to the draft legislative act.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   In the event of a disagreement between the committees concerned under Rules 54 and 55, the detailed rules for the opening of negotiations and the conduct of such negotiations shall be determined by the Chair of the Conference of Committee Chairs in accordance with the principles set out in those Rules.\n\r\

The following general criteria for admissibility of compromise amendments may be applied:\n\r\

-   as a general rule, the compromise amendments relate to parts of the text which have been the subject of amendments prior to the deadline for tabling amendments;\n\r\
\n\r\
-   as a general rule, the compromise amendments are tabled by political groups representing a majority in Parliament, the Chairs or rapporteurs of the committees concerned or the authors of other amendments;\n\r\
\n\r\
-   as a general rule, the compromise amendments entail the withdrawal of other amendments to the same passage.\n\r\
\n\r\
Only the President may propose that a compromise amendment be considered. In order for a compromise amendment to be put to the vote, the President must obtain the agreement of Parliament by asking whether there are any objections to such a vote being held. If an objection is raised, Parliament shall decide on the matter by a majority of the votes cast."

The Conference of Presidents shall submit proposals to Parliament. The composition of the committees shall, as far as possible, reflect the composition of Parliament.\n\r\
\n\r\
When Members change their political group they shall retain, for the remainder of their two-and- a-half year term of office, the seats that they hold in parliamentary committees. However, if a Member's change of political group has the effect of disturbing the fair representation of political views in a committee, new proposals for the composition of that committee are made by the Conference of Presidents in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 1, second sentence, so that the individual rights of the Member concerned are guaranteed.\n\r\
\n\r\
The proportionality of the distribution of committee seats among political groups must not depart from the nearest appropriate whole number. If a group decides not to take seats on a committee, the seats in question will remain vacant and the committee will be reduced in size by the corresponding number. Exchange of seats between political groups is not allowed.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   Amendments to the proposals by the Conference of Presidents shall be admissible only if they are tabled by at least 40 Members. Parliament shall vote on such amendments by secret ballot.\n\r\

3.   Members shall be deemed to have been elected on the basis of the proposals from the Conference of Presidents, as and where amended in accordance with paragraph 2.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   If a political group fails to submit nominations for membership of a committee of inquiry in accordance with paragraph 1 within a time limit set by the Conference of Presidents, the Conference of Presidents shall submit to Parliament only the nominations communicated to it within that time limit.\n\r\
\n\r\
5.   The Conference of Presidents may provisionally decide to fill any vacancy on a committee with the agreement of the persons to be appointed, having regard to paragraph 1.\n\r\

The political groups and the non-attached Members may appoint a number of permanent substitutes for each committee equal to the number of full members representing them on the committee. The President shall be informed accordingly. These permanent substitutes shall be entitled to attend and speak at committee meetings and, if the full member is absent, to take part in the vote.\n\r\
\n\r\
In the event that the seat of a full member of a committee falls vacant, a permanent substitute from the same political group shall be entitled to vote in place of the full member, on a temporary basis, pending the provisional replacement of the full member in accordance with Rule 199(5), or, in the absence of such provisional replacement, pending the appointment of a new full member. Such entitlement is based on Parliament's decision concerning the numerical composition of the committee, and aims at ensuring that the number of members of the political group concerned who can take part in the vote is equal to the number entitled to do so before the seat fell vacant.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   In addition, in the absence of the full member and where permanent substitutes either have not been appointed or are absent, the full member of the committee may arrange to be represented at meetings by another member of the same political group, who shall be entitled to vote. The Chair of the committee shall be notified of the name of the substitute prior to the beginning of the voting session.\n\r\
\n\r\
Paragraph 2 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the non-attached Members.\n\r\
\n\r\
The advance notification provided for in the last sentence of paragraph 2 must be given before the end of the debate or before the opening of the vote on the item or items for which the full member is to be replaced.\n\r\

*\n\r\
*        *\n\r\
The provisions of this Rule encompass two concepts which are clearly defined by this text:\n\r\
\n\r\
-   a political group may not have more permanent substitutes on a committee than it has full members;\n\r\
\n\r\
-   only political groups are entitled to appoint permanent substitutes, on the sole condition that they inform the President.\n\r\
\n\r\
To conclude:\n\r\
\n\r\
-   the status of permanent substitutes depends exclusively on membership of a given political group;\n\r\
\n\r\
-   if the number of a political group's full members in a committee changes, the maximum number of permanent substitutes which it can appoint to that committee changes accordingly;\n\r\
\n\r\
-   Members who change their political group may not keep the status of permanent substitute which they had as members of their original group;\n\r\
\n\r\
-   a committee member may in  no circumstances be a substitute for a colleague who belongs to another political group.\n\r\
\n\r\
\n\r\
(1)	The deletion of Rule 200 decided on 13 December 2016 (P8_TA(2016)0484) shall enter into force only at the opening of the first part-session following the elections to Parliament due to be held in 2019. The Rule is thus reproduced in this version."

\n\r\
11.   Petitions that have been declared inadmissible by the committee shall be filed. The petitioner shall be informed of the decision and the reasons for it. Where possible, alternative means of redress may be recommended.\n\r\
\n\r\
12.   Petitions, once registered, shall become public documents, and the name of the petitioner, possible co-petitioners and possible supporters and the contents of the petition may be published by Parliament for reasons of transparency. The petitioner, co-petitioners and supporters shall be informed accordingly.\n\r\
\n\r\
13.   Notwithstanding paragraph 12, the petitioner, a co-petitioner or a supporter may request that his, her or its name be withheld in order to protect his, her or its privacy, in which case Parliament shall comply with the request.\n\r\
\n\r\
Where the petitioner's complaint cannot be investigated because of the petitioner’s anonymity, the petitioner shall be consulted on the further steps to be taken.\n\r\
\n\r\
14.   In order to protect the rights of third parties, Parliament may, on its own motion or at the request of the third party concerned, anonymise a petition and/or other data contained therein, if it sees fit to do so.\n\r\

15.   Petitions addressed to Parliament by natural or legal persons who are neither citizens of the European Union nor reside in a Member State nor have their registered office in a Member State shall be registered and filed separately. The President shall send a monthly record of such petitions received during the previous month, indicating their subject-matter, to the committee. The committee may ask to see those which it wishes to consider."

The right to speak shall be granted to petitioners at the discretion of the Chair.\n\r\
\n\r\
2.   With regard to an admissible petition, the committee may decide to submit a short motion for a resolution to Parliament, provided that the Conference of Committee Chairs is informed in advance and there is no objection by the Conference of Presidents. Such motions for resolutions shall be placed on the draft agenda of the part-session to be held no later than eight weeks after the adoption of those motions for resolutions in the committee.

\n\r\
3.   After each visit, a mission report shall be drafted by the official members of the delegation. The Head of the delegation shall coordinate the drafting of the report and shall seek consensus on its content among the official members on an equal footing. Failing such a consensus, the mission report shall set out the divergent assessments.\n\r\
\n\r\
Members taking part in the delegation ex officio shall not participate in the drafting of the report.\n\r\
\n\r\
4.   The mission report, including possible recommendations, shall be submitted to the committee. Members may table amendments to the recommendations, but not to the parts of the report concerning the facts established by the delegation.\n\r\
\n\r\
The committee shall first vote on the amendments to the recommendations, if any, then on the mission report as a whole.\n\r\
